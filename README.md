# POWER-BI-PROJECT
Complete Power BI project using HR analytics dataset
The Proffesional  Power BI dashboard project created for HR analytics provides a comprehensive overview of various key metrics related to employee demographics, performance, and attrition. This dashboard is designed to offer actionable insights into the workforce dynamics within an organization, enabling data-driven decision-making.

Technical Overview

Data Integration and Transformation:

The dataset integrates various HR data sources, including employee age, gender, education field, job roles, performance ratings, and attrition rates.
Data transformation processes involve cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This includes handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating calculated columns for derived metrics.

Data Visualization:

The dashboard employs a range of visualizations to represent the data effectively. Bar charts, line charts, and pie charts are used to display metrics such as attrition rates by age group, education field, and gender.
Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the average age of employees, average monthly income, and average years at the company are prominently displayed to provide a quick snapshot of the workforce's status.

Interactive Features:

The dashboard includes interactive features like slicers and filters, allowing users to drill down into specific segments of the data. For example, users can filter the data by department or job role to analyze attrition rates within specific groups.
Tooltip functionality provides additional context when hovering over data points, offering deeper insights without cluttering the visualizations.
General Overview
Employee Demographics:

The dashboard highlights the distribution of employees across various age groups. For instance, it shows that the majority of employees fall within the 26-35 and 36-45 age brackets.
Gender distribution is also visualized, showing the proportion of male and female employees within the organization.

Attrition Analysis:

One of the key focuses of the dashboard is on attrition rates. It breaks down attrition by education field, revealing that the highest attrition rates are observed in Life Sciences and Medical fields.
Attrition by age group is visualized, indicating higher attrition rates among employees aged 26-35 and 36-45.
The dashboard also includes a timeline analysis of attrition by years at the company, providing insights into when employees are most likely to leave.
Performance Metrics:

Performance ratings are analyzed by job role, showing the sum of performance ratings and hourly rates across different roles. This helps identify which roles are performing well and which may need improvement.
The dashboard provides an average performance rating, giving a general sense of employee performance across the organization.

Education and Job Role Distribution:

The distribution of employees across different education fields is visualized, along with the age distribution within each field. This helps in understanding the educational background of the workforce and its impact on various metrics.
The dashboard also shows the count of employees in different job roles, providing a clear picture of the workforce composition.

Data Handling in Power BI

Data Modeling:

Relationships between different tables in the dataset are established using Power BI's data modeling features. This ensures that data is accurately linked and aggregated across various dimensions.
Hierarchies are created to enable easy navigation and drill-down analysis. For example, an age hierarchy might include levels such as age group and individual age.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):

Custom measures and calculated columns are created using DAX to perform complex calculations and aggregations. This includes measures for average income, total attrition, and performance ratings.
DAX is also used to create conditional formatting rules to highlight key insights, such as high attrition rates or outstanding performance ratings.

Report Customization:

The dashboard layout is customized to enhance readability and user experience. This includes arranging visualizations logically, using color schemes to differentiate between metrics, and adding titles and labels for clarity.
Custom visuals and themes are applied to make the dashboard visually appealing and aligned with the organization's branding.
This HR analytics Power BI dashboard is a powerful tool for understanding and managing the workforce. By combining technical data handling with intuitive visualizations, it enables HR professionals to gain insights into employee demographics, performance, and attrition. This, in turn, supports strategic decision-making aimed at improving employee retention, optimizing performance, and fostering a healthy work environment.
